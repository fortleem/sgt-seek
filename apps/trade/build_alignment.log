error: failed to select a version for the requirement `async-graphql-axum = "=0.7.5"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 7.0.17, 7.0.16, 7.0.15, ...
location searched: crates.io index
required by package `sgt-trade v0.1.0 (/Users/tonsy/Documents/sgt-seek/apps/trade)`
if you are looking for the prerelease package it needs to be specified explicitly
    async-graphql-axum = { version = "5.0.0-alpha.5" }
